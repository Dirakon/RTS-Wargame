# RTS-Wargame
My Unity project that implements the basics of RTS: unit movement, abilities, attacks, orders, minimap, unit selection etc... Maybe in future it's going to be developed into something cooler

Actually a pretty fun and ambitious project with a LOT of cool and not-so-easy to implement mechanics that I actually did implement, and I'm proud of this. Not so fun to play tho, I'm not really a game designer. Maybe when I eventually become somewhat of a game designer this project will see it's deserved glory. 

Not only the programming part, I actually modeled the units that are in this version, which was pretty fun.
